# exams R package

Public repository with development version of exams package. 

## Why?

This awesome package is developed in [r-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1337) which is, unfortunately, lacking regarding features as installation with [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html). So to fix this problem I am syncing the development code from r-forge here.

## How frequently is it synced?

I try to sync every week. If you have some need please open an issue.

## How to install from github?

   ```R
   devtools::install_github("flaviobarros/exams")
   ```

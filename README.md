# exams R package

Public repository with development version of exams package. 

# Why?

This awesome package is developed in [r-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1337) which is, unfortunately, lacking regarding features as installation with [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html). So to fix this problem I am syncing the develpement code from r-forge here.
